### Chronicling an Awesome Coding Journey


**Day 1**

There is a lot to learn.

- [ ] Git
- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] Markdown
- [ ] CLI/Terminal/Bash/Zsh
- [x] Bash does **NOT** care that Get sounds the same as Git
- [x] It also case sensitive... *$ git add -a* and *$ git add -A* are not the same.  

### Here are something I have learned so far though.

1. *The Cliffs of Confusion might be a National Park with many cliffs.*

1. Git makes more sense when I actually do it.
1. Its probably best is we don't let the *designers* see these pages yet.

### How to do a collapsable list with MD:

<details> 
<summary> Use this code </summary>

# `# "Whatever heading you want here"`

`<details>`

`<summary> Click this to Expand the List </summary>`

*`Put your list items here`*

`1. One`

`1. Two`

`1. Thirteenteen`

`1. Shfifty-Five`

`</details>`

These tags look more like traditional HTML tags than what we have been using in MD so far.
