## Chronicling an Awesome Coding Journey

***

### Week 3
#### Friday, Feb 11th, 2021

<br>

The Questions Are:

1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
  * I heard these described as the essential elements in a sentence.
    * **Noun**
      * ***HTML*** The subject of the page, the main content.
    * **Adjective**
      * ***CSS*** How it looks, CSS describes the HTML.
    * **Verb**  
      * ***JavaScript*** Action.  JS is all about doing.

Luckily we also have the dictionary, MDN.

1. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

  I'm not sure in includes any Objects currently, and a Web Dev since of the word.

Here is a little mid-week question.

For vs While

For loops for a specified number of times. While runs for as long as a condition is true.

But how is that not the same thing?

See below:

> <code>var i = 0</code>

These results are the same:

> <code>while (i < 10) {
  console.log("The number is " + i);
  i++;
}</code>

> <code>for (let i = 0; i <10; i++) {
>  console.log(‘’The number is ‘ + i);
> }</code>

### Week 2
#### Friday, Feb 5th, 2021

<br>

We have just finished week 2 of our pre-work.  Everyone on <abbr title="Smith, Katy, Harris, Steven, Scott, Eric, and myself">Team Hopper</abbr> had good presentations today for our strangely similar Splash page's.

We had a good talk about uses of Dev Tools and the Document Object Model, or DOM.  We got into talking about the ethics of viewing, borrowing, and using other's code.

Justin and Ian spoke about learning to write code by writing code is much better than not learning to write code by copying code.

That reminded me of a story I read in [Flash Boys by Michael Lewis](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393351599) where it talks about why Russia was producing some of the best programmers ever.  In the West, students had tons of access to computers, but didn't code as well as the Russians who had limited *Machine Time*.

Because the Russian programers may only have an hour or so time on the actual computer a week, they wrote all their code out on paper, and debugged it in their minds.  Not talking about pesudocode either.  This was precise, perfect syntax, and everything.  They also didn't have <u>Stack Exchange</u> to look anything up either...

***Scarce resources are valuable.***

Thinking about that story makes me think I need to reconsider just how valuable pseduocode can be, especially as we add more and more layers and complexity to our projects.

If you aren't familiar with <u>Flash Boys</u>, check it out.  Its the story of how some coders changed Wall Street \(and not in a good way\), long before Reddit, and Robinhood.

### Day 1
#### Monday, Jan 25th, 2021

<br>

There is a lot to learn. 

- [ ] Git
- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] Markdown
- [ ] CLI/Terminal/Bash/Zsh
- [x] Bash does **NOT** care that Get sounds the same as Git
- [x] It also case sensitive... *$ git add -a* and *$ git add -A* are not the same.  

### Here are something I have learned so far though.

1. *The Cliffs of Confusion might be a National Park with many cliffs.*
![Cliffs of Confusion?](https://c.files.bbci.co.uk/166B4/production/_107082819_413a9fc2-e8ef-4dc9-9b0b-c5fa6324f1ab.jpg)

![Falling off Cliff](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BothDarkIguana-small.gif)
1. Git makes more sense when I actually do it.
1. Its probably best is we don't let the *designers* see these pages yet.

### How to do a collapsable list with MD:

<details> 
<summary> Use this code </summary>

# `# "Whatever heading you want here"`

`<details>`

`<summary> Click this to Expand the List </summary>`

*`Put your list items here`*

`1. One`

`1. Two`

`1. Thirteenteen`

`1. Shfifty-Five`

`</details>`

These tags look more like traditional HTML tags than what we have been using in MD so far.

</details>

### *Here is something I learned,  and I am testing:*

* On my old device (Macbook Pro) my directory containing everything in here was backed up to iCloud.
* When I added my Desktop and Documents to be connected to my iCloud on the new device, all the exisiting folders and files showed up.
* When I ran newcomputer % ls -a on the new device, the .git file was there.
* Now I am making these changes we see right now to see if I can push it up the GitHub.  I will update:
* Note:  Any changes I make to the files on either device will change on the other device too, iCloud will sync the most current version of each one.  I may have to experiment and see what happens if I open both at the same time and make different changes.  I imagine it'll be whichever is saved last.
* There is another intresteing thing I'm curious about right now... but as a security issue... I'm not sure I should publish it on the interwebs.  I'll talk about it on our standup.

### Test 2
### Test Again.  Pushing Once at EST: 11:40 AM Monday Feb 1
